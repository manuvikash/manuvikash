💻 Software tinkerer | 🌱 Lifelong learner | 🎓 MSCS @ SJSU (Fall '25)  

I love building things that blend **web, AI and creativity** — from carpooling apps to budget planners to wearables.  
Always experimenting, always learning, usually with ☕ and Lo-Fi in the background.  

---

### ⚡ What I’m up to
- ✨ Hacking on side projects in **AI + full-stack dev**  
- 🌍 Moved from India → US this fall  
- 🏋️ Learning to stick to a gym routine (harder than debugging 😅)

### 🛠️ Tech Playground
